### What is Iris 2D ?
        A 2D game engine that can be used to make much types of 2D game. And also, Iris 2D just has its own convinient tools to help developer get better use of it.
    
### How can I get to use Iris 2D ?
        Well, since you have come to get this page of Github, then I think the most direct function is just to sync this project to you local machine with any git client that you are get used to.
        
        If you have already get the source code of Iris 2D, it depends what you have get:
        
        If you have get the Edition Iris 2D Amethyst you have to configure the right developement environment of the source code you have get (the name of source code folder marked "A" means it can be compiled with MSVC and one marked "B" means it can be compiled with GCC. Also, name marked "API" means what you will get after compiling is a dynamic library and marked "SC" means that is an executable file that you can excute it directly.)
        
        Oh, configuring the development environment is TOO DIFFICULT and you don't kown how to do it? 
        
        Don't worry. Edition Iris 2D Amethyst is not be recommended anymore, it just means you SHOULD NOT pay any attention to it anymore.
        
        Edition Iris 2D Biscuit is the newest edition of Iris 2D, and you can just use CMake to get the development environment easily from the source code you have get - it's very easy to use CMake, google it and you will get more information if you don't kown it.
        
        If you have done it, what you have to do next is just to compile and run what you have get.
        
### How do I learn to use Iris 2D ?
        You can read the source code of Iris 2D's Demo and API Reference Manual(under updating) to learn how to use Iris 2D.
